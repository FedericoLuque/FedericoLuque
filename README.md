# Hi, I'm Federico 👋

**Junior Software Developer | Open Source Contributor | Web & Backend**

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I’m a software developer with a strong foundation in **web development** and real-world coding experience through **active open source contributions**. I transitioned into tech with a focus on continuously building, learning, and collaborating — not just completing tutorials.

## About Me

I build things that matter.  
I contribute code that gets **reviewed, approved, and merged** by real projects.  
I write software that **solves problems** — not just passes exercises.

My journey involves:
- **Frontend & backend development**
- Web applications built with TypeScript, Angular, Python, Java
- Real open source contributions with pull requests accepted

I’m passionate about continuous learning, real-world collaboration, and building a career in software engineering.
